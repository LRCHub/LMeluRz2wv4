[00:00.00] Mic check
[00:04.50] 
[00:11.27] When I was led to you
[00:16.28] I knew you were the one for me
[00:20.21] (Come through, dig the sound)
[00:21.27] I swear the whole world could feel you, MC
[00:27.50] (Crowd around)
[00:34.50] 
[00:31.45] I used to cop a lot, but never copped no drop
[00:34.05] Hold mics like pony tails, tight and bob a lot
[00:37.15] Stop and stick around, come through and dig the sound
[00:39.07] Of the fly brown six-o sicko psycho who throws his dick around
[01:10.07] 
[00:41.88] Bound to go three-plat, came to destroy rap
[00:44.25] It's a intricate plot of a b-boy strap
[00:46.88] Femstat cats get kidnapped
[00:48.67] Then release a statement to the press
[00:50.29] Let the rest know who did that
[01:05.29] 
[00:51.83] Metal Face terrorists claim responsibility
[00:54.14] Broken household name usually said in hostility
[00:57.59] Uhm, what is MF, you silly?
[00:59.37] I'd like to take "Mens to the End" for two milli'
[01:23.87] 
[01:01.73] "Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo!" That's a audio daily double
[01:04.38] Rappers need to fall off just to save me the trouble, yo
[01:06.72] Watch your own back, came in and go out alone, black
[01:09.37] Stay in the zone turn H2O to Cognac
[01:26.87] 
[01:12.21] On Doomsday
[01:13.38] Ever since the womb 'til I'm back where my brother went
[01:15.63] That's what my tomb will say
[01:17.56] Right above my government, Dumile
[01:19.36] Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
[01:42.86] 
[01:21.91] I wrote this one in B.C.D.C., O-section
[01:24.70] If you don't believe me, go get bagged and check then
[01:27.23] Cell number 17, up under the top bunk
[01:29.32] I say this not to be mean, wish bad luck, or pop junk
[01:55.82] 
[01:31.98] Pop the trunk on See-Cipher-Punk, leave him left scraped
[01:34.62] God forbid, if there ain't no escape, blame MF tape
[01:37.24] Definition "super-villain," a killer who love children
[01:39.54] One who is well-skilled in destruction, as well as building
[02:09.04] 
[01:42.24] While Sidney Sheldon teaches the trife to be trifer
[01:44.40] I'm trading science fiction with my man, the live lifer
[01:46.99] A pied piper holler a rhyme, a dollar and a dime
[01:49.60] Do his thing, ring around the white collar crime
[02:13.60] 
[01:51.96] Get out my face, askin' about my case, need toothpaste
[01:54.87] Fresher mint, monkey-style nigga get mentadent
[01:57.14] And dope fiends still in they teens, shook niggas turn witness
[02:00.54] Real mens mind they own business
[02:16.54] 
[02:02.34] That's the difference between sissy-pissy rappers that's double-dutch
[02:05.23] How come I hold the microphone double-clutch?
[02:07.47] C.O.'s make rounds, never have 'ox found
[02:09.58] On shakedown, lock-down, wet dreams of Fox' Brown
[02:34.08] 
[02:12.41] On Doomsday
[02:13.54] Ever since the womb 'til I'm back where my brother went
[02:15.91] That's what my tomb will say
[02:17.77] Right above my government, Dumile
[02:19.87] Either unmarked or engraved, hey, who's to say?
[02:43.37] 
[02:22.77] Doomsday
[02:23.58] Every since the womb 'til I'm back to the essence
[02:25.94] Read it off the tomb
[02:27.20] Either engraved or unmarked grave, who's to say?
[02:29.54] Pass the mic like "Pass the peas, like they used to say"
[02:57.54] 
[02:32.20] Some M-er F-ers don't like how Sally walk
[02:34.92] I'll tell y'all fools it's hella cool how ladies from Cali talk
[02:37.24] Never let her interfere with the Yeti ghetto slang
[02:39.65] Nicknames off nipple and tip of nipples, metal fang
[03:05.15] 
[02:42.55] Known amongst hoes for the bang-bang
[02:44.31] Known amongst foes for flow with no talking orangutangs
[02:47.56] Only gin and Tang
[02:48.88] Guzzled out a rusty tin can
[02:50.46] Me and this mic is like yin and yang
[03:08.46] 
[02:52.60] Clang, crime don't pay, listen, youth
[02:55.27] It's like me holding up the line at the kissing booth
[02:58.06] I took her back to the truck, she was uncouth
[03:00.18] Spittin' all out the sunroof, through her missing tooth
[03:02.84] But then she has a sexy voice, sound like Jazzy Joyce
[03:05.72] So I turned it up faster than a speeding knife
[03:28.72] 
[03:08.13] Strong enough to please a wife
[03:09.79] Able to drop today's math in the 48 keys of life
[03:12.68] Cut the crap, far as rap
[03:14.75] Touch the mic, get the same thing a Arab will do to you for stealing
[03:17.66] What the devil? He's on another level
[03:19.96] It's a word, no, a name, MF, the super-villain
[03:26.95] Doomsday
[03:30.95] 
[03:32.10] Mmm-mmm-mmm
[03:35.07] Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
[03:36.91] (Dig the sound) mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm (crowd around)
[03:41.98] Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
[03:45.14] Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
[03:47.29] Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
[03:52.72] When I was led to you
[03:57.44] I knew you were the one for me
[04:02.42] I swear the whole world could feel you, MC
